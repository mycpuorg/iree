# libIREECompiler.so building
# It's 2023. We were supposed to have sane ways to build shared libraries.
# We were promised.
#
# Anyway, the shared library must be explicitly assembled from the *object
# libraries* that make up its public interface. We could use the new
# $<LINK_LIBRARY:WHOLE_ARCHIVE> feature to bypass this old way of doing it,
# but that interacts badly with BUILD_SHARED_LIBS mode (since it would then
# not be linking the static libraries *into* a composite shared library).
#
# Therefore, we duplicate the object libs from above. They are lexically
# related:
#   1. LLVM derived object libraries are named with an "obj." prefix.
#   2. IREE derived object libraries are named with an ".objects" suffix.
#   3. Alias libraries don't work, so we need to use the "_" vs "::" form.
#
# Given this variance, we opt for simple duplication. Make sure that the list
# below is always kept in sync with the list above for StaticImpl.
#
# Further, we have to separate out the LINK_LIBRARIES dependencies of the
# OBJECTS libraries and include them manually as PRIVATE deps of the shared
# library. This involves some generator shenanigans.
#
# Finally, we allow super-projects to export additional API from our shared
# library by populating the IREE_COMPILER_API_ADDL_EXPORT_OBJECTS.
