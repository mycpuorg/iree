// In order to be helpful as a reference for future architecture-specific
// kernels, the generic kernels are structured like an actual optimized kernel,
// using an "accumulator tile" that in this case is a stack array (which would
// become a group of SIMD registers in an actual optimized kernel). The downside
// of this approach is that we have to set a fixed max size for the accumulator
// tile, but for now all known cases are comfortably far below where trouble
// would happen. For reference:
// - On ARM NEON, the entire register space is 512 bytes, so the accumulator
//   tile is less than that, typically 256 to 384 bytes.
// - On ARM SME, we will be working with an accumulator tile as large as 4096
//   bytes (IIUC).
// - The smallest stack frame size limit that we know we may have to deal with
//   on certain targets is 16 kilobytes.
// The size or architecture-specific tiles is relevant here because this
// generic code is what will be run as a fallback if the device is found not to
// support the CPU feature that the tile sizes were picked to target.
